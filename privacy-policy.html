    <ul>
        <li><strong>On-Device Storage:</strong> Most of your personal preferences, favorites, and settings are stored

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Our App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information

        personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a
        child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our
        servers.</p>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>

    <p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you
        reside. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.</p>

    <p>Specifically, our servers are located in the United States, and our service providers may be located in various
        countries around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information, we may process it in any
        of these countries.</p>

    <p>However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
