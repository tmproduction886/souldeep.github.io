    <ul>
        <li><strong>Free Trial Period:</strong> If applicable, you may be eligible for a free trial of a paid subscription. The free trial period begins when you subscribe and provides full access to the premium features of the selected plan. Unless you cancel before the end of the trial period, you will be automatically charged for the subscription when the trial ends.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Automatic Renewal:</strong> Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period (monthly, yearly, or as specified in your selected plan) unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase or at the end of the free trial period, if applicable.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can cancel your subscription at any time by going to your Apple ID account settings. Cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period, and you will retain access to premium features until that time. We do not provide refunds for the unused portion of a subscription period.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Price Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to change our subscription plans and pricing at any time. Any price changes will be communicated to you, and you will have the opportunity to accept the new price or cancel your subscription before it takes effect.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Subscription Management:</strong> You are responsible for managing your subscription through your Apple ID account settings. We cannot directly cancel or refund purchases made through the App Store.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL SOUL DEEP BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE APP; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE APP; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE APP; AND (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>
    
    <p>IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES IS NOT ALLOWED, OUR LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
    
    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Soul Deep and its licensees, licensors, and service providers from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms or your use of the App.</p>
    
    <h2>11. Third-Party Links and Content</h2>
    
    <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Soul Deep.

You further acknowledge and agree that Soul Deep shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such websites or services.</p>
    
    <h2>12. iOS App Store Additional Terms</h2>
    
    <p>These Terms are between you and Soul Deep, not with Apple Inc. ("Apple"). Apple is not responsible for the App and its content. Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.</p>
    
    <p>In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App.</p>
    
    <p>Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>
    
    <p>Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party's intellectual property rights.</p>
    
    <p>You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the App.</p>
    
    <p>Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary.</p>
    
    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
    
    <p>Upon termination, your right to use the App will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the App and delete it from your device.</p>
    
    <h2>14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
    
    <p>Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration in San Francisco, California, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.</p>
    
    <h2>15. Class Action Waiver</h2>
    
    <p>ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A NAMED OR UNNAMED MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LEGAL ACTION.</p>
    
    <h2>16. Severability and Waiver</h2>
    
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>
    
    <h2>17. Entire Agreement</h2>
    
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Soul Deep regarding our App and supersede all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements between you and Soul Deep.</p>
